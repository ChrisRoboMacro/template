USE ONE LINER TO UPDATE Template.py:
Bash> git pull origin main && git add . && git commit -m "Update Template.py " && git push origin main
PS> git pull origin main; git add .; git commit -m "Update Template.py"; git push origin main



... broken down:

git pull origin main
git add Template.py
git add .
git commit -m "Update Template.py to remove extreme datapoints if not in the last 13 observations"
git push origin main




OK all working! So next time I update Template.py on my PC what do I do to then save it to github
ChatGPT
Great to hear that everything is working now! For future updates to Template.py or any other files in your repository, here’s a straightforward workflow to follow to ensure your changes are saved and pushed to GitHub:

Step 1: Make Your Changes
Open Template.py in your editor (like Visual Studio Code or any other editor), make the necessary changes, and save the file.

Step 2: Stage the Changes
Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to your project directory if you're not already there:

bash
Copy code
cd C:\Users\WINDOWS\Desktop\CODING\RoboMacro_May2024
Stage the changes you made to Template.py using the git add command. This command starts tracking changes to the file:

bash
Copy code
git add Template.py
If you've made changes to multiple files and want to stage all changes at once, you can use:

bash
Copy code
git add .
This command adds all modified files to the staging area.

Step 3: Commit the Changes
Commit your staged changes with a descriptive message. This records your changes in the local git repository:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Update Template.py with new features"
Replace the message with something descriptive about what changes or enhancements you have made.

Step 4: Pull the Latest Changes from GitHub
Before pushing your changes to GitHub, it's a good practice to pull the latest changes from the remote repository to ensure there are no conflicts:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
This step is crucial if others are also working on the same repository. It updates your local branch with the latest upstream changes and helps avoid merge conflicts.

Step 5: Push the Changes to GitHub
Finally, push your committed changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
This command sends your committed changes to the main branch of the remote repository (i.e., GitHub). If you are working on a different branch, replace main with your branch name.

Additional Tips
Check Status: Use git status frequently to see which files are modified and staged for commit.
View Changes: If you want to see what changes have been staged, use:
bash
Copy code
git diff --cached
This shows the difference between your last commit and what’s currently staged.
Handling Conflicts: If your git pull results in conflicts, you'll need to manually resolve them in the affected files. After resolving conflicts, you need to add the resolved files to staging again and then continue as normal.
Regular Commits: Make commits often with clear messages. This practice keeps your changes documented and organized, and reduces the risk of losing important work.
By following this workflow, you can efficiently manage and synchronize your local development changes with your GitHub repository.
